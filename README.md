## 📌 Project Overview: Simple 6-Axis Robot Arm Control Demo

This project implements a control system for a stationary 6-axis robot arm using Python in the backend and a simple web-based frontend interface for visualization and interaction. The robot arm simulates joint movement with angle constraints and executes smooth transitions between positions.

The application is fully containerized using Docker 🐳 for easy deployment and portability.

## 🛠️ Features

- Define and simulate a 6-axis robot arm
- Input joint angles via ...
- Smooth movement using linear interpolation
- Live visualization of joint states in browser
- Simple GUI for manual control
- Dockerized frontend and backend for cross-platform execution
